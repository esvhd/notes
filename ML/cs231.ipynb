    "Good example in video that implemented a check after initalizing a network, feed data through the network without regularization and check the loss, on CIFAR-10 the expected loss is $-log(1/10) \\approx 2.3$.\n",

    "**Tip**: make sure that you can **overfit** very small portion of the training data. If you can't overfit a small portion of the data, then things are broken.\n",

    "### Second Order Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses **Hessian** matrix, this will have faster convergence, and **no hyperparameter**!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when training large networks, the Hessian matrix ends up being quite huge, inversing it becomes impractically expensive to evaluate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**L-BFGS** is usually used for second order optimization, however, it works for **deterministic** functions. This means it **does not work in minibatch settings**. \n",

    "Adam is usually a good choice, if you can afford to do full batch updates, then try L-BFGS. \n",
