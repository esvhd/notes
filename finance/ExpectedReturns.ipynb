    "\n",
    "#### Prospect Theory (PT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Main findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* people care more about gains and losses (changes in wealth) than about the overall size of wealth\n",
    "* people exhibit loss aversion and can be risk-seeking when facing the probability of loss (depends on framing);\n",
    "* people overweight low-probability events\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to add other assumptions such as **narrow framing** and **house money effect** to generate testable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**narrow framing** involves analyzing problems in too isolated a fashion. **Reference point** is important in this context, and is related to **disposition effect**, which refers to investors' tendency to hang on to losers (reference is trade entry). Trading volume can be used together with disposition effect to forecast investors' behaviour, e.g. large volume follwed by large loss, investors may be biased on hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ambiguity aversion** - people dislike vague uncertainty more than objective uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regret aversion** - motivated to minimize regret\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moods and feelings** - Observed strong performance around holidy periods (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Japanese Golden Week).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Shiller argues that equity bubles have **four elements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preceipitating factors\n",
    "* Amplification mechanisms\n",
    "* Cultural factors\n",
    "* Psychologic factors: overconfidence, representativeness (extrapolating from a recent uptrend), herding\n",
    "\n",
    "Soros' **reflexivity theory** - the feedback loop between market participants' understanding of the environment and the environment itself, through investor actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory biases** - risk factors' ex ante excess returns seem to be higher for a long while after a large negative factor shock. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Money illusion** - confusing nominal and real returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Sectional trading / Micro-ineffiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-sectional opportunities are safer to exploit than market directional opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long term reversal effect** - stocks that underperformed in the last 12 to 36 months tend to outperform afterwards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short to Medium-term momentum effect** - stocks that outperformed in recent months tend to outperform for up to 12 months ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autocorrelation** - financial time series exhibit **positive** autocorrelation over short horizon and (less consistently) negative autocorrelation over multi-year horizons.\n",

Used the last 24 months as OOS test, results look pretty impressive for the OOS period. At the end of June 2017 this measures points to a 90% confidence band of -6% to +9% future performance for 7-10yr UST (BAML's G4O2 Index).\n",

    "* Level dependent inflation uncertainty\n",
    "* equity and/or recession hedging ability\n",
    "* supply-demand factors\n",
    "* cyclical effects\n",

    "Ilmanen's opinion is that long term variation in the BRP has been primarily driven by a **level-dependent inflation premium**. This is the **only** premium that can move yields by several percentage points, the yield impact of other factors amounts at most to 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also argume that linear regression based models cannot capture the variation of the impact of these factors to BRP at different times. Each factor's importance rises and falls depending on the situations we are in. The author sort of mentioned this, pointing out that survey based measures do not impose assumptions like regression based methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Views\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent predictabiliy of returns may reflect systematic forecast errors due to irrational investor expectations or structural uncertainty (gradual learning of structural or regime changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types of errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* expectation errors on short rates. When policy rates are abnormally high or low, the market expects **fast** mean reversion and is initially surprised by the persistence of the policy stance. On a 4-5yr horizon yield forecasts tend to be correct. (Me: not the recovery post GCF)\n",
    "\n",
