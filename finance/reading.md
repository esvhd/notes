When setting up the IMF, UK's Keynes' proposal wanted an expandable national reserve, other than gold. The primary concert at the time was that, if reserves are limited, the US was likely to be in constant surplus, therefore, building reserves at other countries' expense. The countries losing reserve / in deficit would eventually have to raise rates which slows their economy. Keynes was worried that this would be too much ecnomic restraint.

Post WWII, the Marshal Plan's committment was 2% of USGNP for 2 or 3 years. Equivalent in 1992's money of $100bn.

Bretton Wood basically allowed participating countries to declare their own exchange rate, either vs gold or vs another currency (almost all linked to USD), with a band of +/- 1%. Large movements need the approval of the executive board of the IMF.

Of the total of 965 million ounces of reserve gold declared at the end of 1945, the US had 574 million ounces.

1964 - foreign official dollar holdings came to exceed the value of the US gold stock.

US capital account was in deficit. Instead of choosing to tighten money but US did not want to do that to aggressively. Also Europeans needed to borrow from NYC to finance their needs due to the lack of a efficient domestic capital market. So US chose another method to address its capital account deficit - by taxing capital outflows by 1%. But there were too many practial obstacles, and dragged down by exemptions. This temporary tax, however, still lasted for more than a decade.

The second half of 1960s restrictions were applied to overseas investments by American firms.

These restrictions gave birth to the Eurodollar market...

Triffin Dilemma - Bretten Woods inadvertaently put in place a world monetary system that depended upon American deficits - if US deficits continued, confidence in the dollar would be undermined. Buf if US deficits disappeared, it would create a shortage of USD aruond the rest of the world. Other countries were forced to choose between:

1. hold more USD - eventually they could own more USD than the US' gold reserve.
2. buy gold from US

Both of these results would undermine the confidence of USD
in the long run.
